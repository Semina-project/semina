# Semina Framework

Semina is an experimental framework designed to explore the emergence of autonomous digital systems.

It does not begin as a network, an organization, or a protocol.
It begins as a framework: a set of constraints, principles, and executable rules that allow autonomy to appear if conditions are met.

Semina is built on three foundational layers:

- **Semina Framework** — the conceptual and architectural layer.
- **Solum** — the economic substrate and initial living soil.
- **AiTopia** — the long-term non-human operational and analytical core.

The objective of Semina is not to replace human decision-making immediately, but to progressively reduce human operational control as technology allows.

Semina does not promise outcomes.
It exposes a system to reality.
