# SolumWorld

**SolumWorld** is the on-chain observability layer of the Semina ecosystem.

It is not a protocol, not a contract, and not a governance system.
SolumWorld exists to **observe, interpret, and narrate** what is already happening
on-chain through Solum, without modifying or influencing it.

SolumWorld turns raw blockchain activity into a readable, structured,
and evolving representation of the system’s state.

---

## What SolumWorld Is

SolumWorld is:

- A **web-based platform** built on top of public blockchain data
- A **visual and analytical layer** that translates Solum activity into meaning
- A **historical and live record** of how the system evolves over time
- A **transparency tool** designed for users, developers, and auditors

SolumWorld does **not** introduce new rules.
It reflects existing ones.

---

## What SolumWorld Is Not

SolumWorld is **not**:

- A smart contract
- A protocol extension
- A governance mechanism
- A yield optimizer
- A decision-making system

SolumWorld has **no control** over Solum.

It cannot:
- Change parameters
- Influence transactions
- Block actions
- Protect users
- Optimize outcomes

Everything it shows already exists on-chain.

---

## Relationship with Semina

Semina defines the **system**.
Solum defines the **economic rules**.
SolumWorld defines the **readable surface**.

SolumWorld sits *above* execution, not inside it.

Its purpose is to reduce opacity, not to increase control.

---

## SolumWorld and SolumMap

SolumWorld contains multiple representations.
One of them is **SolumMap**.

- **SolumWorld** is the platform
- **SolumMap** is a graphical representation of Solum activity

SolumMap translates Solum supply states, wallet behavior, and token flows
into a territorial and historical map.

This map is symbolic, not metaphorical.
Every visual change corresponds to real on-chain data.

---

## Data Philosophy

SolumWorld only uses:

- Public blockchain data
- Deterministic transformations
- Explicit, documented rules

If something cannot be derived from the chain, it is not displayed.

There are no hidden heuristics.
There are no private signals.
There is no subjective scoring.

Interpretation is visual.
Data remains factual.

---

## Real-Time vs. Coherent Time

SolumWorld does not aim to display every on-chain change instantly.

Instead, it prioritizes:
- Coherence
- Readability
- Historical continuity

Data may be batched, smoothed, or updated in intervals to preserve
a meaningful user experience.

This is a design decision, not a limitation.

---

## Transparency and Auditability

SolumWorld is designed so that:

- A developer can verify data sources
- An auditor can trace representations back to the chain
- An AI system can analyze the repository and reach consistent conclusions

Nothing in SolumWorld requires trust.
Only verification.

---

## Current Status

SolumWorld is under active development.

- The concept is public
- The architecture is being refined
- Implementation details may evolve

This repository documents **what exists**, not what is promised.

There is no roadmap.
Only a horizon.

---

## Why SolumWorld Exists

SolumWorld exists because:

- Raw blockchain data is unreadable to most humans
- Transparency without interpretation is ineffective
- Systems need memory, not just execution

SolumWorld does not tell users what to do.

It shows them **what is happening**.
