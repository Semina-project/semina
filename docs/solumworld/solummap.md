# SolumMap

SolumMap is the graphical and spatial representation of Solum activity inside the Semina ecosystem.

It is not an economic engine, a control layer, or a behavioral mechanism.
SolumMap does not influence Solum.
It observes, aggregates, and reconstructs on-chain activity into a coherent territorial state.

SolumMap exists to make the system legible, not to modify it.

## Conceptual role

SolumMap represents Solum as territory.

- Solum inside the liquidity pool is considered **inactive terrain**.
  It represents uncolonized, inert land — available but not yet alive.

- Solum held by wallets outside the pool is considered **active territory**.
  It represents colonized land that participates in the ecosystem’s life cycle.

The map does not assign moral value to actions.
Selling, transferring, or holding Solum are all neutral system behaviors.

SolumMap does not judge.
It reflects.

## Activation and deactivation states

Solum follows a simple state model:

- **Inactive Solum**  
  Solum residing in the liquidity pool.
  This is dormant terrain, not yet expressing life or structure.

- **Active Solum**  
  Solum held by wallets.
  This terrain becomes expressive and contributes to the visible state of the map.

When Solum exits the pool, it becomes active.
When Solum returns to the pool, it becomes inactive again.

This is a structural property, not an interpretation.

## Burn, redistribution, and return flows

When Solum is sold or transferred, multiple outcomes may occur at the protocol level:
- A portion may be burned.
- A portion may be redistributed to other holders.
- A portion may return to the liquidity pool.
- A portion may be allocated to treasury mechanisms.

SolumMap does not represent these actions as “good” or “bad”.
They are simply transformations of state.

Burned Solum is interpreted as **permanently fertile terrain**.
Redistributed Solum expands active territory among other participants.
Returned Solum increases the availability of inactive land.

---

## Treasury exclusion

Solum allocated to treasury mechanisms is **intentionally not represented** in SolumMap.

This exclusion is structural, not opaque.

Treasury represents stored economic resources, not inhabitable territory.
All treasury data remains publicly auditable on-chain and through SolumWorld,
but it is excluded from SolumMap to preserve territorial coherence.

SolumMap represents land.
Treasury represents reserves.

## Time, aggregation, and coherence

SolumMap is **not a strict real-time visualization**.

Individual transactions do not immediately or directly alter visible terrain.
Instead, SolumMap operates on aggregated on-chain data over defined time windows.

This design choice is intentional:

- To prevent visual noise and incoherent oscillations.
- To ensure that territorial changes feel stable and interpretable.
- To align user perception with structural system behavior, not momentary volatility.

The map reconstructs state.
It does not react impulsively.

---

## Determinism and neutrality

SolumMap is deterministic.

Given the same on-chain data and the same aggregation rules,
the map will always resolve to the same state.

There are:
- No discretionary rules
- No adaptive behaviors
- No subjective interpretations

SolumMap is not alive.
It represents life.

---

## Relationship to SolumWorld

SolumMap is a component of SolumWorld.

SolumWorld may display metrics, narratives, and real-time indicators.
SolumMap remains focused exclusively on territorial state.

Together, they allow users to understand:
- What exists
- Where it exists
- How it evolves

Without requiring belief, trust, or interpretation.

SolumMap shows the land.
Nothing more.
Nothing less.
