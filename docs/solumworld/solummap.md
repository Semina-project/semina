# SolumMap — Spatial Representation of On-Chain Civilization

## Definition

**SolumMap** is the spatial and visual representation of SolumWorld.

If SolumWorld is the platform and living system,  
**SolumMap is its territory**.

SolumMap translates on-chain state into a persistent, evolving map where economic activity becomes geography.

---

## Scale and Structure

SolumMap is defined as a finite terrain composed of Solum units:

- Total area: **100 trillion Solum units**
- Representation: discrete blocks (conceptually 1 m² per block)
- Each block reflects the state of Solum at that position in time

This does not imply ownership by default.
It implies **representation**, not allocation.

---

## Terrain Semantics

Each type of on-chain state alters the terrain:

- **Solum in liquidity pools**  
  → barren or unstable land  
  (potential, but fragile)

- **Burned Solum**  
  → forests, rivers, lakes  
  (fertility through transformation)

- **Treasury accumulation**  
  → infrastructure, resilience, permanence

- **Inactive Solum**  
  → dormant land, waiting potential

No transformation is cosmetic.
Each visual change maps to a real economic process.

## Wallets as Settlements

Wallets are represented as settlements whose form evolves over time:

- Small holdings → plots, farms
- Long-term holding → villages
- Large or persistent activity → cities
- High interaction → trade routes

Status is not assigned.
It **emerges**.

There is no ranking of “good” or “bad” wallets.
Only visible behavior and its cumulative effects.

---

## Neutral Interpretation Principle

SolumMap enforces strict neutrality:

- Selling is not destruction.
- Burning is not loss.
- Accumulation is not dominance.
- Movement is not instability.

Every action contributes to the map.
Every contribution is informational.

Meaning arises from:
- duration
- repetition
- interaction
- correlation

Not from intention.

## Relationship to SolumWorld and Semina

SolumMap is:

- a sub-system of SolumWorld
- a visualization layer with semantic depth
- a continuous dataset for analysis and learning

For **Semina**, SolumMap provides:
- observable decentralized behavior
- real-time systemic feedback
- a living laboratory for autonomy and emergence

For **Aitopia**, SolumMap is:
- a structured environment to observe
- a source of non-synthetic behavioral data
- a foundation for future interpretative intelligence

---

## Foundational Principle

SolumMap does not optimize outcomes.
It preserves information.

It does not guide behavior.
It records it.

It does not judge the system.
It **reveals it**.

---

## Closing Statement

SolumWorld is the ecosystem.  
SolumMap is the land.

Semina does not dictate civilization.
It allows one to form.
