# SolumMap — Living Spatial Representation

SolumMap is a conceptual and visual representation of the Solum ecosystem.
It is not a game, not a simulation, and not a promise of future mechanics.
It is a way to *read* on-chain activity as a living territory.

SolumMap translates economic states into spatial metaphors.

## Core Principle: Solum Has States

Solum exists in two fundamental states:

### 1. Dormant Solum (Inactive)

- Solum held inside the liquidity pool
- Represents **infertile land**
- No identity, no history, no activity
- Pure availability

The liquidity pool always represents **uncolonized territory**.
It is land that exists, but has not yet been brought to life.

### 2. Active Solum

- Solum held outside the pool, in wallets
- Represents **colonized land**
- Carries history, behavior, and impact
- Can generate value, memory, and transformation

Leaving the pool is the act of **colonization**.

---

## Colonists (Wallets)

Wallets are represented as settlements:
- parcels
- farms
- villages
- cities

Their form depends on:
- amount of active Solum
- duration of holding
- interaction behavior (hold, transfer, sell)

There is no moral judgment.
Only different forms of contribution.

## What Happens When Solum Is Sold

Selling Solum is not destruction.
It is **territorial transformation**.

When a colonist sells Solum, the previously active land is transformed through four simultaneous processes:

### 1. Burn — Permanent Fertility

A portion of Solum is burned.
This land becomes:
- forests
- rivers
- fertile zones

It never returns to circulation.
It is permanent enrichment of the world.

### 2. Redistribution — Shared Harvest

A portion is distributed to other holders.
This represents:
- harvest
- shared growth
- expansion of active territory for others

### 3. Return to Pool — Availability

A portion returns to the liquidity pool.
This land becomes:
- inactive
- infertile
- available again for colonization

The pool always reflects how much land is still open.

### 4. Treasury — System Resources

A portion feeds the treasury.
This represents:
- resources for SolumWorld
- resources for Semina
- capacity for future development

## No Good or Bad Actions

Holding, selling, transferring:
- none are punished
- none are privileged

Every action contributes differently.

SolumMap exists to show that:
- value is transformed, not erased
- behavior creates landscape
- the system evolves without judgment

---

## Relationship With SolumWorld and Semina

- **SolumWorld** is the platform where this world is observed
- **SolumMap** is the visual language of the system
- **Semina** learns from the data generated by this evolution

SolumMap is not a feature roadmap.
It is a lens.

A way to see an autonomous system become a living world.
