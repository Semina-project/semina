# SolumMap

SolumMap is a conceptual representation of Solum as a living territory.

It is not a simulation and not a game.
It is a way of translating on-chain state into spatial form.

Each unit of Solum corresponds to a finite portion of land.
The state of that land changes as the system evolves.

## Core idea

- Solum held in liquidity represents undeveloped or sterile terrain.
- Solum removed from circulation (burned) is interpreted as fertility,
  allowing the appearance of forests, rivers, and life.
- Wallets are represented as settlements whose form depends on:
  - size
  - activity
  - longevity

The territory is not static.
It evolves only as a consequence of real system behavior.

## Purpose

SolumMap exists to make long-term dynamics visible.

It does not optimize, incentivize, or interfere.
It observes.

This document defines the concept only.
Implementation details are intentionally undefined.
