# Semina — Horizon

## What Horizon Is

Horizon is not a roadmap.

It does not describe milestones, deadlines, features, or delivery targets.  
It exists to define **how Semina relates to the future**, not what that future will contain.

Horizon is a conceptual boundary:
- between intention and outcome
- between design and emergence
- between control and evolution

Semina does not move toward a predefined destination.  
It remains oriented toward an open horizon.

## Why Semina Has No Roadmap

A roadmap implies:
- a known destination
- a controllable sequence of steps
- the ability to guarantee progression

Semina rejects these assumptions.

The system is designed to:
- expose structure before optimization
- allow behavior to emerge under fixed rules
- evolve through interaction rather than execution plans

Publishing a roadmap would create a false signal of certainty.  
Horizon exists to avoid that distortion.

## Horizon as Orientation, Not Direction

Horizon does not define *where* Semina will arrive.  
It defines *how Semina remains oriented* while it evolves.

This orientation is governed by three conditions:

1. **Rule Stability**  
   Core rules are fixed before scale is pursued.

2. **Observed Emergence**  
   Change is allowed to surface through interaction, not enforcement.

3. **Constraint Respect**  
   The system evolves around its limits, not by removing them.

Horizon preserves these conditions without projecting outcomes.

## Horizon and Participation

Participation in Semina does not assume progress toward a reward.

It assumes:
- engagement with an unfinished system
- acceptance of fixed constraints
- tolerance for uncertainty

Horizon makes one thing explicit:
Semina is not late.  
It is not early.  
It is simply *not destination-driven*.

## Horizon and Time

Time in Semina is not segmented into phases with goals.

There is:
- no launch phase with expectations
- no growth phase with targets
- no maturity phase with closure

There is only:
- rule persistence
- interaction
- accumulation of observable history

Horizon remains constant regardless of system age.

---

## What Horizon Does Not Contain

Horizon does not include:
- timelines
- KPIs
- promises
- projections
- guarantees
- narratives of inevitability

If something is not visible in deployed rules or public documentation, it is not implied by Horizon.

---

## Closing Statement

Semina does not walk a path.  
It defines a field.

Horizon is the acknowledgment that:
the most important behaviors of the system  
cannot be specified in advance  
without breaking the system itself.
