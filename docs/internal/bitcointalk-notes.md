## What is Semina?

Semina is a conceptual framework.
It is not a finished product, a company, or a roadmap-driven project.

Semina describes a system designed to evolve over time through mechanisms,
not through promises or predefined outcomes.

---

## What is Solum?

Solum is the first observable and operational layer within Semina.

It is a token deployed on Base, designed to live inside a public DEX pool
and to demonstrate how early participation can be structured mechanically.

For details, always refer to:
`docs/solum-token-phase-1.md`

---

## Is this an investment?

No.

Semina and Solum are not presented as investment products.
There are no guarantees, profit expectations, or promised outcomes.

Participation is optional and experimental.

---

## What are the taxes?

Solum uses different tax profiles depending on how the token moves:

- **Buy:** 1% (0.5% LP + 0.5% Treasury)
- **Sell:** 10% (4% Burn + 3% Reflections + 2% LP + 1% Treasury)
- **Transfer:** 5% (2% Burn + 3% Reflections)

All details are documented in:
`docs/solum-token-phase-1.md`

---

## Why is there a transfer tax?

Transfers represent a change of custody.

Untaxed transfers would allow silent reshuffling of supply
without interacting with the pool.

The transfer tax ensures that when Solum changes hands,
the system is reinforced mechanically.

---

## Is the contract frozen / immutable?

The contract parameters are fixed and documented in the repository.

There is no minting, no inflation, and no adjustable fee configuration.
The code in GitHub is the reference implementation.

---

## Who is the team?

There is no traditional team narrative.

There is a limited human executive factor responsible for deployment
and early operational tasks.

The long-term design goal is system continuity, not human protagonism.

---

## Is there a roadmap?

No.

Semina does not operate on a traditional roadmap model.
Time and observation are considered part of the design.

Future developments, if any, depend on system behavior,
not on pre-announced milestones.

---

## Where should questions be answered?

Public questions should always be answered by:
- quoting the documentation
- linking to the relevant file
- or stating clearly that something is not defined yet

Do not speculate.
Do not promise.
Do not defend beyond what is written.
