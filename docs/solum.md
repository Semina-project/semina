# Solum

Solum is the economic substrate of Semina.

It represents the initial soil in which the framework can take root, attract participation, and generate the minimal resources required for survival and growth.

Solum begins as a reflection-based token because it is the most elementary and efficient form of a living economic system:
minimal initial resources,
continuous redistribution,
and autonomous behavior defined entirely by code.

Early participation is intentionally accessible.
This is not a privilege system.
It is an attempt to allow many participants to occupy a portion of the soil before concentration occurs.

Solum is not only an asset.
It is a form of belonging.

Holders should not be understood as passive investors, but as beneficiaries of the system’s evolution.
As Semina grows, Solum is expected to evolve as well, always under conditions of proportionality.

Solum is necessary for Semina.
Semina is beneficial for Solum.

If Semina advances, Solum advances.
If Semina fails to generate value, Solum cannot sustain itself.

In this sense, Solum holders are not owners of Semina,
but they are structurally aligned with the future value creation of the system.
