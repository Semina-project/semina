This commit archives the Aitopia alignment milestone as a historical document.

It is intentionally placed outside the active documentation flow to prevent reinterpretation,
mythologization, or accidental elevation of scope.

The document records a specific moment of human–AI operational alignment during the early
formation of Semina, without granting autonomy, authority, or continuity beyond documentation.

This file is not normative. It is historical.
