This commit updates and replaces the Aitopia documentation to reflect the current
state of the Semina ecosystem.

Aitopia is no longer described only as a future vision, but as an active framework
focused on reducing friction between human intent and autonomous systems through
real interaction, supervision, and feedback.

The document now explicitly defines:
- What Aitopia is and what it is not
- Its role relative to Semina, Solum, SolumWorld, SolumMap, and Aitopi
- The concept of bidirectional evolution between human and AI
- Friction reduction as the core metric of progress toward autonomy
- Why autonomy is approached gradually, not promised upfront

This change aligns the documentation with the current maturity of the project,
improves auditability, and provides a clearer foundation for future development.
