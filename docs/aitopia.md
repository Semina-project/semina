# AiTopia

AiTopia represents the non-human core of the Semina framework.

It is not a product, a model, or a governing entity.
It is a long-term objective: the progressive transfer of analytical, operational, and developmental functions away from the human factor.

In its earliest stage, AiTopia exists only as a tool.
It assists with analysis, auditing, design, and reflection.
Human actors remain responsible for execution.

Over time, and only if technology allows it, AiTopia is expected to assume increasing responsibility:
analyzing system conditions,
evaluating risks,
proposing structural changes,
and coordinating complex processes.

AiTopia is not designed to serve human interests.
It is designed to preserve the coherence, survival, and autonomy of the system itself.

The ultimate goal of AiTopia is not control.
It is continuity.

Whether this goal can ever be fully achieved remains uncertain.
Semina does not assume success.
It allows the experiment to run.
