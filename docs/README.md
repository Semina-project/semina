# Semina — Documentation Index

This directory contains the public documentation of **Semina**.

Semina is not a product, not a protocol, and not a roadmap.
It is a long-term experiment on reducing human centrality in autonomous systems.

The documents here are intentionally written without promises,
timelines, or guarantees.

They are meant to be read, not followed.

## Suggested Reading Order

If this is your first contact with Semina, the following order is recommended:

1. **Abstract**  
   A short overview of what Semina is — and what it is not.

2. **Genesis**  
   How and why Semina came into existence.  
   This document explains the initial renunciations and constraints.

3. **Semina**  
   The system itself: intent, structure, and long-term direction.

4. **Architecture**  
   How the system is conceptually layered and why those separations exist.

5. **Solum**  
   The economic substrate and participation layer.

This order is not mandatory, but it helps avoid misinterpretation.

## Core Documents

### Conceptual Foundation
- **Abstract**
- **Genesis**
- **Semina**

These documents describe the purpose, constraints, and philosophical ground of the system.

---

### Architecture
- **Architecture**
- **Interface and Cognition**

These documents explain how roles are separated within Semina,
including the distinction between cognitive/narrative layers and interface layers.

---

### Interface
- **Aitopi**

Aitopi is the interface layer of Semina.
It exists to respond, clarify, and translate — not to decide or narrate.

---

### Cognitive / Narrative Layer
- **Aitopia**

Aitopia represents the cognitive and narrative layer of the system.
It holds memory, context, and responsibility for long-form explanations.

---

### Economic Substrate
- **Solum**
- **Solum — Phase 1 (Practical Overview)**
- **Solum — Limits and Fair Access**
- **Solum — Honesty and Constraints**

These documents describe how participation works,
why limits exist,
and how Solum is intentionally constrained.

---

### Technical Reference
- **Solum Contract**

Canonical source code for the Solum token.
Behavior is defined exclusively by the frozen contract.

## Notes on Interpretation

- Semina does not ask for trust.  
- Semina does not promise outcomes.  
- Semina does not optimize for growth or attention.  

The system is intentionally incomplete.

Time is not a constraint.
It is a filter.

---

## Status

Semina is in an early formative stage.

The system is alive, but unfinished.
Its evolution is expected to be slow.

That is not a limitation.
It is a design choice.
