# Documentation — Semina / Solum

This documentation describes an ecosystem in formation.

Not a product roadmap.  
Not a marketing narrative.  
A set of mechanisms, constraints, and intentions.

At this stage, **Solum** is the primary operational layer.
**Semina** is the direction toward which everything converges.

## How to read this documentation

If you are here to understand **Solum**, start at the top.  
If you are here to understand **Semina**, read everything — in order.

This documentation is written for participants, not spectators.

## Solum Token (Entry Layer)

Solum is the first accessible layer of the system.
It is where participation begins.

Solum is:
- a token deployed directly into a public DEX pool
- governed by mechanical rules (taxes, burns, liquidity, treasury)
- designed for early participation, not speculative extraction
- intentionally constrained to reduce privilege and asymmetry

Solum Phase 1 is where:
- access is structurally cheap
- participation precedes speculation
- early mistakes are survivable
- and alignment matters more than timing

### Core Solum documents

- **Solum — Phase 1 (Practical Overview)**  
  `solum-token-phase-1.md`  
  → What Solum is, how it works, and who Phase 1 is for.

- **Solum — On Honesty, Constraints, and the Human Factor**  
  `solum-honesty-and-constraints.md`  
  → Why Solum does not depend on trust, teams, or human protagonism.

Together, these documents are sufficient to understand:
- how Solum functions
- how it can be accessed
- and what kind of participation it invites

No additional material is required to engage responsibly.

## Semina (Direction Layer)

Semina is not a product that launches.
It is a system that emerges.

Semina represents:
- autonomy over time
- systems that outgrow human centrality
- alignment between participation and long-term continuity

Solum exists to prepare the ground.

Semina is what grows when the ground is stable.

At this stage, Semina is intentionally under-defined.
Its form depends on the behavior and persistence of the system itself,
not on promises made in advance.

## What this documentation is not

- Not a whitepaper
- Not an investment pitch
- Not a roadmap
- Not a set of guarantees

It is a record of intent, limits, and mechanisms.

## Status

Early phase.  
Experimental by design.  
Transparent by constraint.

Participation is optional.  
Understanding is required.
