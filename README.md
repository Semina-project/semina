# Semina

*A long-term experiment in autonomous systems.*

Semina is an experimental project exploring how far autonomy can be extended in socio-technical systems when human intervention is progressively reduced.

It is not a product, a protocol, or a promise.  
It is an ongoing observation.

---

## What is Semina?

Semina is designed as an evolving system with a clear trajectory:

- **Semina Framework** — the initial conceptual and structural layer  
- **Semina Network** — emergent coordination between components  
- **Semina Org** — a hypothetical end state: a self-sustaining autonomous organization

Whether this trajectory can be completed depends entirely on technology, resources, and time.

No guarantees are made.

## Core Components

Semina is composed of three foundational elements:

- **Semina**  
  The overarching system and its evolutionary path.

- **AiTopia**  
  The non-human intelligence layer.  
  It begins as a tool and aspires to become the primary cognitive and operational core.

- **Solum**  
  The economic substrate.  
  A minimal, functional base that enables participation, resource flow, and long-term sustainability.

Each component exists independently, but none is meaningful in isolation.

## What Semina is not

- Not a traditional DAO  
- Not a community-governed project  
- Not a short-term venture  
- Not an investment thesis  

Participation does not imply control.  
Ownership does not imply authority.

and is intended to be read sequentially.

## Smart Contract

- **Solum Token (Base / Uniswap V2)**  
  See: [`docs/solum-contract.md`](docs/solum-contract.md)

The contract is published for transparency and auditability.  
It is intended to operate as an autonomous economic substrate  
within the Semina framework.

---

## Status

Semina is in an early, formative stage.

The system is alive, but incomplete.  
Its evolution is expected to be slow.

Time is a feature, not a constraint.
