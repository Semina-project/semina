# Semina

Semina is an experimental on-chain ecosystem designed to explore how autonomous systems can emerge, persist, and evolve with minimal human intervention.

It is not a product, not a protocol with a roadmap, and not a promise of outcomes.  
Semina defines a horizon, not a destination.

The project is built around a simple premise:  
**Can a system be designed to remain coherent, observable, and viable while progressively reducing human centrality?**

## Core Components

Semina is composed of three clearly separated layers:

### 1) Solum — Economic Substrate
Solum is the on-chain economic layer of Semina.  
It defines rules of value flow, friction, and constraint inside the system.

Solum is implemented as a fixed-rule ERC-20 smart contract on **Base**.  
Its behavior is intentionally constrained, predictable, and non-adaptive in early phases.

Solum does not promise returns.  
It defines the terrain on which participation occurs.

Canonical reference:
- Smart contract source: `contract/SolumToken.sol`

### 2) SolumWorld — Observability & Visualization Layer
SolumWorld is a public-facing visualization and observability layer.

Its purpose is to transform raw on-chain activity into an understandable system:
- movements
- constraints
- accumulation
- distribution
- burn
- participation patterns

SolumWorld does not alter the system.  
It observes it.

Public documentation:
- `docs/solumworld/`

### 3) Aitopia — Cognitive & Interpretive Layer
Aitopia represents the long-term conceptual horizon of Semina.

It is not a deployed AI system at this stage.  
It is the framework through which Semina’s data, constraints, and behavior may eventually be interpreted, learned from, and evolved.

Aitopia does not control Solum.  
It observes, contextualizes, and (in future phases) may learn from system behavior.

## Design Principles

Semina explicitly prioritizes:
- rule clarity over optimization
- observability over opacity
- stability over short-term efficiency
- participation over speculation
- coherence over speed

There is intentionally:
- no roadmap
- no growth promises
- no adaptive parameter tuning in early phases

Uncertainty is not hidden.  
It is treated as a first-class design condition.

---

## Development State

Semina is currently in an early formative stage.

- The Solum contract is stable and auditable
- Documentation is evolving
- SolumWorld is under active conceptual and technical development
- Tooling, UX, and integrations are incomplete by design

This is not presented as a weakness, but as a conscious choice to expose the system gradually and honestly.

## Final Note

Semina does not ask for belief.  
It asks for understanding.

Solum defines the rules.  
SolumWorld makes them visible.  
Aitopia defines the horizon.

Everything else is left intentionally open.
