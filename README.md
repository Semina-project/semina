# Semina  
*A long-term experiment in autonomous systems*

Semina is an experimental framework exploring whether autonomous digital organisms can emerge from the combination of smart contracts, artificial intelligence, and constrained human participation.

It is not a product, a protocol, or a company.  
It is an exposed system designed to evolve under explicit structural limits.

Semina does not promise outcomes.  
It allows reality to validate — or invalidate — its design.

## Core Components

**Semina Framework**  
The conceptual and architectural layer.  
Semina begins as a framework before becoming a network or an organization.

**AiTopia**  
The non-human analytical and operational objective.  
Initially a tool, progressively intended to assume greater responsibility if technology allows.

**Solum**  
The economic substrate and community soil.  
A minimal, living economic layer designed to sustain participation, generate resources, and align long-term incentives.

## Why Semina Exists

The emergence of smart contracts introduced executable, non-discretionary systems.  
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence introduces non-human analytical capacity.

Semina exists to explore the intersection of both.

Autonomy is treated as a **direction**, not a claim.  
Human operational control is not eliminated by decree, but progressively reduced as systems become capable of sustaining themselves.

## Current Status

- Early-stage experimental framework  
- Public research and documentation  
- No timelines  
- No guaranteed outcomes  

Semina evolves only if conditions allow it to do so.

## Disclaimer

Semina is an experimental research project.

Participation implies understanding that:
- the system may fail,
- assumptions may prove incorrect,
- and no economic or functional guarantees are made.

This repository is the canonical public record of the experiment.
