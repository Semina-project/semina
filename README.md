# Semina

Semina is an experimental ecosystem exploring how fixed on-chain rules, artificial intelligence, and human participation can coexist to form autonomous, long-living systems.

It is not a finished product.  
It is not optimized for short-term outcomes.  
It is a controlled, observable environment designed to evolve over time.

Semina prioritizes structure, transparency, and persistence over speed, hype, or narrative optimization.

## Project Status

**Current phase:** Alpha / Early Beta  
**Technical source of truth:** GitHub (this repository)

This repository reflects an actively evolving system.

- Some components are stable by design.
- Others are intentionally exposed while unfinished.
- Development is incremental and transparent.

This is a conscious choice, not a limitation.

## Core Components

### Solum — On-chain Economic Substrate

Solum is the native token and economic layer of Semina.

It defines:
- how value enters the system,
- how it circulates,
- how it exits,
- and which constraints apply.

Solum is rule-based and designed for predictability rather than adaptability.

**Authority:** the contract and the repository.  
Nothing exists beyond what is encoded and documented.

- Documentation: `docs/solum/`

---

### SolumWorld — On-chain Civilization

SolumWorld is the observation and visualization layer of Solum.

It treats Solum as terrain and wallets as participants (“colonists”).  
Its purpose is not to influence behavior, but to **observe, expose, and contextualize** how a fixed-rule economic system evolves once inhabited by real actors.

SolumWorld emphasizes:
- transparency over optimization,
- structure over sentiment,
- long-term system behavior over individual outcomes.

Public documentation is available.  
Implementation is currently developed in a private environment.

- Documentation: `docs/solumworld/`

### Aitopia — Public Interface (AI-assisted)

Aitopia is the public-facing communication layer of the Semina ecosystem.

It contextualizes progress, vision, and updates, but it does not define technical truth.  
All authoritative definitions remain on-chain or in this repository.

Aitopia communicates.  
Semina executes.

## Documentation

All documentation lives under `docs/` and is organized by domain.

- Solum: `docs/solum/`
- SolumWorld: `docs/solumworld/`
- Architecture (evolving): `docs/architecture/`

Each directory contains its own README acting as an index.

If a statement is not reflected in the contract or documented here, it should not be treated as a promise.

## Design Philosophy (Short)

Semina does not optimize for certainty.  
It optimizes for legibility.

Semina does not guarantee outcomes.  
It guarantees rules.

Solum defines the ground.  
SolumWorld shows what grows.  
Semina observes what endures.

## Disclaimer

Semina is experimental.

Participation involves risk.  
Early-stage behavior can be volatile.  
No guarantees are implied.

Understanding precedes participation.  
Observation precedes optimization.
