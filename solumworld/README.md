# SolumWorld
Genesis README — v1

What is SolumWorld?

SolumWorld is an exploratory visualization and analysis layer built on top of Solum, the economic substrate of the Semina ecosystem.

It is not a game.
It is not a trading dashboard.
It is not a governance interface.

SolumWorld exists to observe, interpret, and expose how a rule-based on-chain system behaves once it is alive.

Nothing here modifies Solum.
Everything here reads, maps, and makes visible what already exists on-chain.


Core Concept

- Solum is the terrain
- Wallets are the colonists
- Transactions are movements across the terrain
- Taxes, limits, and burns are environmental forces
- Time reveals structure

SolumWorld treats the Solum contract as a living system whose behavior can be observed without interference.


Purpose

1. Transparency

SolumWorld exposes all relevant Solum activity in a readable, interpretable form:
- Buys
- Sells
- Transfers
- Burns
- Liquidity effects
- Treasury flows

No hidden interpretation layers.
No selective visibility.


2. Interpretation (not judgment)

SolumWorld does not label behavior as good or bad.

Selling is not evil.
Holding is not virtuous.
Transferring is not suspicious.

Each action contributes differently to:
- liquidity
- distribution
- taxes, burns, and reflections

SolumWorld shows what happens, not what should happen.


3. Community Mapping

SolumWorld introduces the concept of colonists:
wallets interacting with Solum over time.

Colonists may be represented with:
- activity history
- persistence over time
- contribution metrics (liquidity impact, taxes paid, burns triggered)

This is observational, not punitive.
Any status or reputation system is informational only.


What SolumWorld Is Not

SolumWorld is explicitly not:
- a trading terminal
- a price prediction tool
- a recommendation engine
- a profit leaderboard
- a moderation or enforcement layer

It does not influence Solum.
It does not intervene.
It does not optimize outcomes.


Relationship to Semina

Semina defines the horizon.
Solum defines the ground rules.
SolumWorld defines the lens.

SolumWorld exists so system behavior can be studied early,
assumptions can be validated or broken,
and future layers of Semina can be designed with real data.

SolumWorld is a research surface, not a product feature.


Development Status

Status: Private development (Genesis phase)

- No public endpoints
- No guarantees of completeness
- Experimental UX and representation
- Evolving data models

SolumWorld will remain read-only by design.


Design Principles

- Transparency over polish
- Observation over persuasion
- Structure over narrative
- Data before conclusions
- No hidden logic

If something is not visible on-chain, SolumWorld does not invent it.


Why SolumWorld Exists This Early

Most systems explain themselves after growth.
SolumWorld exists to understand Solum while it is still fragile.

This allows:
- early detection of emergent behavior
- honest discussion of system dynamics
- a shared reference frame for the community

Not to promise success,
but to see clearly.


Final Note

SolumWorld does not tell you what to do.
It shows you where you are standing.

Understanding precedes participation.
