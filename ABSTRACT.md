# Abstract

Semina is an experimental attempt to explore whether autonomous digital organisms can emerge from the combination of smart contracts, artificial intelligence, and constrained human participation.

Rather than proposing a finished system, Semina exposes a framework in which autonomy, governance, and value creation are allowed to evolve under explicit structural limits.

This document serves as a technical and conceptual entry point to the project.
