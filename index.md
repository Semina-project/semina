## ⟡ What Semina Is

Semina is **not** a product.  
It is **not** a roadmap.  
It is **not** a promise of returns.

**Semina is an experiment.**

An attempt to design a coherent system that can remain viable over time  
while progressively reducing human centrality.

It defines a **horizon**, not a path.

---

## ⟡ Design Principles

Semina is built around a small set of non-negotiable priorities:

- **Coherence over speed**
- **Habitability over valuation**
- **Accessibility over early optimization**
- **Direction over control**

If a design decision violates one of these,
the decision is rejected.

---

## ⟡ What Exists Today

Semina currently operates as a layered system.
Each layer has a clear role.
No layer tries to do everything.

---

### ▢ Solum  
**Economic substrate**

Solum is the on-chain unit of participation and space.

It does not represent ownership in the traditional sense.
It represents the right to **inhabit**, **participate**, and **shape territory**.

Early Solum design intentionally prioritizes:
- low entry cost
- broad accessibility
- colonization before valuation

Solum behavior is defined by code, not narrative.

---

### ▢ SolumMap  
**Analytical interface**

SolumMap visualizes the global state of the system.

It shows:
- density
- distribution
- activity patterns
- large-scale behavior

SolumMap is **not designed to be beautiful**.
It is designed to be **readable**.

Most users will only need it occasionally.

That is intentional.

---

### ▢ Wallet View  
**Local perspective**

Wallet View shifts scale from global to personal.

It allows any wallet to be located and explored as territory.

Key characteristics:
- automatic scale adaptation
- zoom based on territory size
- no artificial limits imposed on perception

Here, Solum stops being abstract.

Here, territory becomes **place**.

---

### ▢ SolumWorld  
**Experiential layer**

SolumWorld is where lived experience may emerge.

It is intentionally separated from SolumMap:
- analysis and experience do not compete
- abstraction and life remain distinct

Looking at a system  
is not the same as living inside it.

---

## ⟡ What Does *Not* Exist Yet

Semina does **not** currently have:

- a finalized governance model  
- autonomous decision-making AI  
- economic equilibrium  
- guarantees of adoption  
- a defined end state  

These absences are **explicit**.

Some elements are intentionally left undecided,
because defining them too early would lock the system
into assumptions that may not survive time.

Uncertainty is not hidden.  
It is acknowledged.

---

## ⟡ Transparency & Curiosity

All relevant on-chain data is public.

Semina does not:
- restrict observation
- discourage analysis
- hide system behavior

Curiosity is expected.

Participants are encouraged to:
- explore
- compare
- question
- disengage if they choose

Semina does not demand belief.

## ⟡ What This Repository Is

This repository is the **source of truth** for:

- conceptual foundations
- design constraints
- technical references
- interface experiments
- explanatory material

It is **not**:
- marketing
- an investment guide
- a roadmap

It is documentation of a system
that is still becoming.

---

## ⟡ Status

Semina is early.  
Semina is incomplete.

Everything here may evolve,
but changes will always be:
- documented
- explained
- constrained by the same principles

Semina does not rush.

It waits until change is honest.
