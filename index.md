# Semina

*A long-term experiment in autonomous systems.*

---

Semina is an experimental project exploring how far autonomy can be extended  
in socio-technical systems when human intervention is progressively reduced.

It is not a product.  
It is not a protocol.  
It is not a promise.

It is an ongoing observation.

---

## The trajectory

Semina is designed as an evolving system with a clear direction:

**Semina Framework**  
The initial conceptual and structural layer.

**Semina Network**  
Emergent coordination between autonomous components.

**Semina Org**  
A hypothetical end state:  
a self-sustaining autonomous organization.

Whether this trajectory can be completed  
depends entirely on technology, resources, and time.

No guarantees are made.

## Core elements

Semina exists through the interaction of three foundational components.

### Semina  
The system itself.  
Its structure, direction, and long-term intent.

### AiTopia  
The non-human intelligence layer.  
It begins as a tool  
and aspires to become the primary cognitive and operational core.

### Solum  
The economic substrate.  
The minimal ground layer that enables participation,  
resource flow, and long-term sustainability.

Each component can exist independently,  
but none is meaningful in isolation.

## What Semina is not

- It is not a traditional DAO  
- It is not community-governed  
- It is not a short-term venture  
- It is not an investment thesis  

Participation does not imply control.  
Ownership does not imply authority.

## Documentation

All conceptual documentation lives in `/docs`  
and is intended to be read sequentially.

**Recommended starting points:**
- `docs/abstract.md`
- `docs/GENESIS.md`

---

## Status

Semina is in an early formative stage.

The system is alive, but incomplete.  
Its evolution is expected to be slow.

Time is a feature, not a constraint.

*Semina does not ask for belief.*  
*It only asks to be observed.*
