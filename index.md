# Semina

*A long-term experiment in autonomous systems.*

---

Semina is an experimental project exploring how far autonomy can be extended  
in socio-technical systems when human intervention is progressively reduced.

It is not a product.  
It is not a protocol.  
It is not a promise.

It is an ongoing observation.

---

## Direction

Semina is designed as an evolving system with a clear trajectory:

**Semina Framework**  
The initial conceptual and structural layer.

**Semina Network**  
Emergent coordination between autonomous components.

**Semina Org**  
A hypothetical end state:  
a self-sustaining autonomous organization.

Whether this trajectory can be completed  
depends entirely on technology, resources, and time.

No guarantees are made.

## Core elements

Semina exists through the interaction of three foundational components:

- **Semina** — the system and its evolutionary intent  
- **AiTopia** — the non-human intelligence layer  
- **Solum** — the economic substrate and ground of participation  

Each component can exist independently,  
but none is meaningful in isolation.

## Documentation

The project is defined through its documentation.  
All conceptual material lives in `/docs` and is intended to be read in order.

- [Abstract](docs/abstract.md)
- [Genesis](docs/GENESIS.md)
- [Semina Framework](docs/semina.md)
- [Solum](docs/solum.md)
- [AiTopia](docs/aitopia.md)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)

## Status

Semina is in an early formative stage.

The system is alive, but incomplete.  
Its evolution is expected to be slow.

Time is a feature, not a constraint.

*Semina does not ask for belief.*  
*It only asks to be observed.*
